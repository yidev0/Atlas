# Atlas
 
## What is Atlas?
Imagine Launchpad, but App Library. (and more compact)
It shows your apps in the Applications folder on your Mac, not full screen, but as a popup like the downloads folder in the dock.

## Why not Spotlight?
If you use Spotlight on your Mac, you don't need this. Spotlight is more faster as a way to find apps.
If you use Launchpad, this is the replacement you need.

## Features
- [x] Popup from the dock
- [x] Menu Bar app
- [ ] Smart search(color and icon using on-device ML)
